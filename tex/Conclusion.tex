\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}
The project consisted of 3 goals: generating optimal data for different environments, and evaluating agreement of different heuristic models and the $\tau-switch$ model with the optimal data as well as the given human data. The first step was to understand how different environments can be obtained by different parameter settings of the beta distribution $Beta(\alpha, \beta)$ and then implementing sampling rewards for the optimal model. The decisions and rewards obtained from the optimal model make intuitive sense, depending on the prior confidence in the environment ($\alpha + \beta$), and expected rate of the rewards ($\alpha/ (\alpha + \beta)$). We found that our implementation does agree with the results of the paper \cite{shunan2011} to some extent. The fact that we use a different comparison metric (match percentage) instead of posterior predictive agreement used in \cite{shunan2011} might be the reason for the differences.
