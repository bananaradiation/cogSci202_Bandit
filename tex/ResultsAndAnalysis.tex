Figure~\ref{plot1} shows the agreement of each of the heuristic models with the decisions obtained using the optimal model, for each of the three environment settings. The agreement with optimal is maximum for the `plentiful' environment for most of the heuristics, which agrees with the results in the original paper.

\subsection{Comparison with human data}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{plot2} shows the agreement of the heuristics with the human data for each of the 10 subjects. The 10 bars for the WSLS have been sorted in increasing order of agreement, while the bars for the remaining heuristics follow this sorted order of the participants.
